# iOS Guest Speaker Orientation
First of all, thank you. Our guest speakers are a huge part of our class, and we're very excited to have you.

## Context
Fridays are a change-of-pace day for the students. The main goal for Fridays is to review and solidify the content from the week. Instead of a lecture with new core content, our Guest Speaker series is a chance for students to see something cool, meet people in the iOS community, and do some Q&A with experienced developers. 

Friday mornings generally look as follows:

9:30 - Breakfast, provided by DevMountain
10:00 - Guest Speaker Presentation
11:00 - Guest Speaker Q&A

The Q&A ranges anywhere from 10-30 minutes. The listed times are flexible. We've had guest speakers come in early, or after lunch, or even on other days of the week.

## Topics
We have a list of great topics for students, but we've found that our Guest Speakers do a fantastic job when they tell us their story and show us something cool they've worked on. Here is a list of great topics we've had:

* Writing Clean Code
* SceneKit
* WatchKit
* Swift
* My Journey to Becoming an iOS Developer
* How to Land Your First Contracting Gig
* How to Land Your First Job

If you're still struggling to come up with something to present, contact the cohort's Lead Instructor for more ideas.
